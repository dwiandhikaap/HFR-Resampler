You can use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install OpenCV and numpy.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## âœ¨ Usage

Currently it's still so complicated to do stuff with this, but for now here's how to use it :
1. install the dependecies
2. clone this stuff
3. move/copy your video input to the same directory as where the ```.py``` file is
4. make sure your video input is an ```.mp4``` format and named ```input.mp4```
5. run ```resample.py```
6. if it's working, it will output the resampled frames to the ```output``` folder
7. once it finished, you can reconstruct the video using ```ffmpeg```, you can google it if you don't know how to do it.
8. merge audio from original video and your resampled video together, you can use ```ffmpeg```. Again, google it if you don't know how.
9. yeah i think that's it, thank you for listening to my ted talk

yeah i know the difference between gaussian and pyramid is subtle, but it'll become adjustable in the future

## âœ¨ Usage

Currently it's still so complicated to do stuff with this, but for now here's how to use it :
1. download the latest executable file release 
2. make a folder called `output` in the same directory as the executable file
3. copy/move ur high frame-rate video file to the same folder mentioned in step 2
4. run `resample.exe` , it will ask you every info it needs to resample, like file name, output fps, etc.
5. if it's working, it will output the resampled frames to the output folder
6. once it finished, you can reconstruct the video using ffmpeg, you can google it if you don't know how to do it.
7. merge audio from original video and your resampled video together, you can use ffmpeg. Again, google it if you don't know how.
8. yeah i think that's it, thank you for listening to my ted talk
